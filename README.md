# TaskManagerApplication

Challenge/Context: This project aimed to create a task management system to help users organize and prioritize their tasks efficiently. The challenge was to develop a web-based application accessible from any device with an internet connection, while also ensuring user authentication, data security, and seamless task management capabilities.

Action: Leveraging the ASP.NET Core framework and Entity Framework, we built a web application with Razor Pages for the user interface and a backend service to handle authentication, data storage, and task management logic. We employed the C# language for backend implementation and utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development. Azure was chosen as the hosting platform to ensure scalability and reliability.

Result: The project resulted in a fully functional task management system that allows users to create, edit, prioritize, and delete tasks with ease. The application provides a user-friendly interface accessible from any web browser, promoting flexibility and productivity. User authentication and data security are ensured through ASP.NET Core Identity and secure database storage.

Reflection: Throughout the project, we gained valuable experience in ASP.NET Core development, Entity Framework, and web application deployment on cloud platforms. Challenges were encountered during implementation, particularly in handling complex task relationships and ensuring data integrity. However, through collaboration and continuous learning, we successfully delivered a robust solution. In future projects, we would explore additional features such as task sharing and real-time collaboration to further enhance user experience.
